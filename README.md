## What is Grid Trading?

Grid trading is a type of trading strategy that involves placing buy and sell orders at predefined intervals above and below a set price. The goal is to capitalize on normal price volatility in the market, buying low and selling high.

### Simple Example

Suppose the price of a cryptocurrency is $3000, and you set up a grid with the following parameters:

- **Grid levels**: $2900, $2950, $3000, $3050, $3100
- **Buy orders**: Set at $2900 and $2950
- **Sell orders**: Set at $3050 and $3100

As the price fluctuates, the bot will automatically execute buy orders as the price decreases and sell orders as the price increases, allowing you to profit from market swings.
