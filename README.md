## ü§î What is Grid Trading?

Grid trading is a trading strategy that places buy and sell orders at predefined intervals above and below a set price. The goal is to capitalize on market volatility by buying low and selling high at different price points. There are two primary types of grid trading: **arithmetic** and **geometric**.

### üî¢ **Arithmetic Grid Trading**

In an arithmetic grid, the grid levels (price intervals) are spaced **equally**. The distance between each buy and sell order is constant, providing a more straightforward strategy for fluctuating markets.

#### **Example**

Suppose the price of a cryptocurrency is $3000, and you set up a grid with the following parameters:

- **Grid levels**: $2900, $2950, $3000, $3050, $3100
- **Buy orders**: Set at $2900 and $2950
- **Sell orders**: Set at $3050 and $3100

As the price fluctuates, the bot will automatically execute buy orders as the price decreases and sell orders as the price increases. This method profits from small, predictable price fluctuations, as the intervals between buy/sell orders are consistent (in this case, $50).

### üìê **Geometric Grid Trading**

In a geometric grid, the grid levels are spaced **proportionally** or by a percentage. The intervals between price levels increase or decrease exponentially based on a set percentage, making this grid type more suited for assets with higher volatility.

#### **Simple Example**

Suppose the price of a cryptocurrency is $3000, and you set up a geometric grid with a 5% spacing between levels. The price intervals will not be equally spaced but will grow or shrink based on the percentage.

- **Grid levels**: $2700, $2835, $2975, $3125, $3280
- **Buy orders**: Set at $2700 and $2835
- **Sell orders**: Set at $3125 and $3280

As the price fluctuates, buy orders are executed at lower levels and sell orders at higher levels, but the grid is proportional. This strategy is better for markets that experience exponential price movements.

### üìÖ **When to Use Each Type?**

- **Arithmetic grids** are ideal for assets with more stable, linear price fluctuations.
- **Geometric grids** are better for assets with significant, unpredictable volatility, as they adapt more flexibly to market swings.


### üÜö Simple Grid vs. Hedged Grid Strategies

- **Simple Grid**: Independent buy and sell grids. Profits from each grid level are standalone.
- **Hedged Grid**: Pairs buy and sell levels dynamically, balancing risk and reward for higher volatility markets.

## üñ•Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

This project leverages [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for managing virtual environments and dependencies. Below, you‚Äôll find instructions for getting started with uv, along with an alternative approach using **venv**. While not covered in detail here, you can also easily set up the project using **Poetry**.

### Setting Up the Environment

#### Using `uv` (Recommended)

1. **Install `uv` (if not already installed)**  
   Ensure `uv` is installed on your system. If not, install it with `pip`:
  ```sh
  pip install uv
  ```

2. **Clone the repository**:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/jordantete/grid_trading_bot.git
  cd grid_trading_bot
  ```

3.  **Install Dependencies and Set Up Virtual Environment**:
  Run the following command to automatically set up a virtual environment and install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`:
  ```sh
   uv sync --all-extras --dev
  ```

#### Using `venv` and `pip` (Alternative)

1. **Clone the repository**:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/jordantete/grid_trading_bot.git
  cd grid_trading_bot
  ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
  Create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```sh
  python3 -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
  Use pip to install the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
  Note: You may need to generate a requirements.txt file from pyproject.toml if it‚Äôs not already present. You can use a tool like pipreqs or manually extract dependencies.

## üìã Configuration

The bot is configured via a JSON file `config/config.json` to suit your trading needs, alongside a `.env` file to securely store sensitive credentials and environment variables. Below is an example configuration file and a breakdown of all parameters.

  Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. If not, follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).


2. **Start the Services**  
  Run the following command to spin up Grafana, Loki, and Promtail:

  ```sh
  docker-compose up -d
  ```


3. **Access Grafana Dashboards**
  
  Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the Grafana dashboard.
  Use the following default credentials to log in:

	- Username: admin
	- Password: YourGrafanaPasswordHere (as defined in the .env file)

4. **Import Dashboards**

  Go to the Dashboards section in Grafana and click Import. Use the provided JSON file for predefined dashboards. This file can be found in the project directory: ```grafana/dashboards/grid_trading_bot_dashboard.json```
